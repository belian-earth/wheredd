Description: Provides streamlined access to forest carbon offset project
    boundary data from the Akshata, et al. (2024) forest carbon boundaries
    dataset (<https://zenodo.org/records/11459391>), converted to parquet by
    Alex Logan and hosted on Source Cooperative
    (<https://source.coop/cecil/forest-carbon-boundaries>). Creates a local
    DuckDB database with validated, cleaned project geometries from REDD+
    (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and other
    carbon offset projects worldwide. Enables spatial queries and filtering by
    location, registry, or project attributes. Focuses on data access—analytical
    functionality is left to R's spatial and data analysis ecosystem (sf,
    dplyr, terra, etc.).
